# React Portfolio

## About
This application will allow users to view a page that showcases my skills, past projects, and links to my github/social media/email address.
Each project has a functioning link to it that will allow the user to be directed over to the repository of that project.

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
